                           </p>

                           <p>

                              those services may set a cookie even where you do not click a button. As is the case for all cookies, we cannot access those set by social networks,
                              just as those social networks cannot access cookies we set ourselves.

                                While we will not share information that identifies you by name with unaffiliated third parties for their own use,
                                such third parties may be able to identify you with sufficient data from other sources. 
                                You can control what advertisements you receive via the privacy settings on the relevant provider's platform and you should consult the third party's help/support center for more information.
