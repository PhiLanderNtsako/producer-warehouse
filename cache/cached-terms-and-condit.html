                     or terms of use or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Service or to a service or product offered via the Service (in each such instance, and collectively “Additional Terms”).

For any product or service that you order on the Service, you agree to pay the price applicable (including any sales taxes and surcharges) as of the time you submit the order. producerWarehouse will automatically bill your credit card or other form of payment submitted as part of the order process for such price.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
  <li><b>Subscription Term & Termination</b></li>
     <ol type = "a">
       <li> Except in the event of a free trial offer, your subscription will commence as of the date your payment for a subscription is received by producerWarehouse. Your subscription will continue in full force for the length of the term you specifically purchased or on a month-to-month term until such time as you cancel the subscription as further explained below (the "Subscription Term"). In the event that you cancel a subscription in the middle of your Subscription Term, you will not be entitled to receive a refund for the unused portion of the remainder of that Subscription Term.</li>
       <li> producerWarehouse will have the right, upon written notice to you, to terminate these Terms, and suspend your access to your subscription, if: (a) you fail to pay producerWarehouse any amount due to producerWarehouse under these Terms; and/or (b) you materially breach any term or condition of these Terms. producerWarehouse shall have the right to terminate these Terms and suspend your access to your subscription with or without cause, upon thirty (30) days written notice to you in which case you will no longer be charged for access to the subscription. Upon the expiration or termination of these Terms for any reason, your access to, and your use of, your subscription will terminate. </li></ol>
       <li><b> Free Trials/Promotional Offerings</b></li>
       <ol type = "a">
       <li> We may offer promotional trial subscriptions to access the Service for free for a limited time or at special discounted prices. If you sign up for a trial use, your rights to use the Service are limited by the terms of such trial and will terminate or renew on the terms of your trial arrangement and/or any applicable Additional Terms. Please be aware that when you sign up for a free trial, you will be required to provide your credit card number and producerWarehouse will confirm your credit card is valid. When we process your credit card, some credit card companies may place a temporary hold on your account for your first payment. Please contact your credit card company if you have questions. Please note that we do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering. </li></ol>
   <li><b> Auto-Renewal of Membership</b></li>
       <ol type ="a">
       <li> Your subscription to the applicable subscription on the Service will automatically renew at the end of your Subscription Term continuously and indefinitely without action by the member, and the membership fee is charged to the member at the time of renewal. An enrollee whose membership fee has been paid is entitled to all privileges included in the membership until the membership is cancelled by the enrolled member as set forth in the paragraph below. By providing your payment method information for your subscription, you are agreeing to pay a subscription fee, that will automatically renew, at the then current rate, unless you cancel prior to the expiration of the current Subscription Term, and any applicable taxes and service fees (collectively, "Fees").</li>
      <li> The Fees will be charged to your original payment method automatically at the beginning of your Subscription Term, and at the beginning of each renewal Subscription Term thereafter on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your current Subscription Term, unless you cancel your subscription or your account is suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms. The renewal Subscription Term will be the same length as your initial Subscription Term unless otherwise disclosed to you at the time of sale. The rate for the renewal Subscription Term will be the then current subscription-rate.</li>
      <li>  The Fees charged to your payment method may vary from Subscription Term to Subscription Term due to changes in your subscription plan or applicable taxes, and you authorize producerWarehouse to charge your payment method for these amounts. producerWarehouse reserves the right to change the pricing of subscriptions at any time. In the event of a price change, producerWarehouse will post the new pricing on the Service and attempt to notify you in advance by sending an email to the address you have registered for your account. You agree that we may change the pricing we charge you for your subscription and any products/services offered in your subscription package by providing you with notice through an electronic communication from us and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. You consent to our ability to change our pricing and the details of our subscription packages through an electronic communication to you. If you do not wish to accept a price or subscription package change made by us, you may cancel your subscription as described below, otherwise you will be deemed to have consented to the price/subscription package change and authorize producerWarehouse to charge the new Fees to your payment method. If there are any discrepancies in billing, you hereby waive your right to dispute such discrepancies if you do not notify producerWarehouse within sixty (60) days after they first appear on an account statement. </li></ol>
    <li><b>Cancellation of Membership</b></li>
    <ol type ="a"><li>
        A member will have the right to cancel your subscription at any time upon notice to producerWarehouse by email at support@producerWarehouse.com or by visiting 

    to manage your subscriptions. Cancellation of initial membership any time after purchase will result in forfeiture of the membership fee. To avoid a late cancellation fee or forfeiture of the membership renewal fee, membership should be cancelled prior to the end of the then current Subscription Term. Upon cancellation, the member loses access to the areas of the Service designated for members only. This could include any credit and other data and analyses that have been displayed during your membership. To the extent that you continued to get charged after cancellation of your membership due to producerWarehouse error or otherwise, you agree that your sole remedy will be to receive a refund from producerWarehouse for the overcharged amounts.</li></ol>
<li><b>Methods of Payment, Credit Card Terms and Taxes</b></li>
<ol type ="a"><li>All payments must be made via Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JCB, Discover and Paypal. We currently do not accept cash, personal or business checks or any other payment form, although in the future we may change this policy. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You represent and warrant that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so.</li>
   <li> YOU, AND NOT producerWarehouse, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY. You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. Unless you notify producerWarehouse of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes. If producerWarehouse does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by producerWarehouse or its agents. Sales taxes, or other taxes, customs, import/export charges, or similar governmental charges are not included in the price of the products. You are responsible for paying any such taxes or charges imposed on your purchases, including, but not limited to, sales, use or value-added taxes. producerWarehouse shall automatically charge and withhold the applicable tax for orders to be delivered to addresses within and any states or localities that it deems is required in accordance with our order policy in effect at the time of purchase.</li></ol>
<li><b>Refund Policy</b></li>
  <ol type ="a"><li>All purchase transactions made through the Service are subject to producerWarehouse' return policy in effect at the time of purchase. Currently, producerWarehouse' refund policy is to not offer any refunds for any subscriptions or products purchased through the Service, except in our sole and absolute discretion.</li></ol>

  <li><b>Order Acceptance Policy</b></li>
  <ol type ="a"><li>Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. producerWarehouse reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. producerWarehouse further reserves the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Your order will be deemed accepted by producerWarehouse upon our delivery of products or services that you have ordered.</li>
   <li> We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order or if we provide you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that: (a) we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion or the quantity not provided (if your credit card has already been charged for the order); or (b) we will not charge your credit card for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not provided.</li>
    <li> 
          Do not assume that a cancellation or change of an order you have placed with producerWarehouse has been effected until you receive a confirmation from producerWarehouse via email or the Service. As stated above, you will be responsible for, and your credit card or third-party payment account may be charged for, the payment of all fees associated with orders already processed or shipped before your cancellation/change request or a request to terminate your account was received.

        <li>
           producerWarehouse will respond appropriately to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), as set forth below. If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner's) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send us a written notice, using this<a href ="#">form</a> that includes at minimum all of the following information:<ol type ="1">

        <li> 
            a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL or page of the Service on which the material appears);
        </li>

<li>producerWarehouse will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives that are submitting using the following<a href ="#">form:</a></li>
<ol type ="1">
<li>It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. producerWarehouse may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and producerWarehouse may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.</li>
<li>Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.</li>
<li>We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.</li>
<li>Without limiting producerWarehouse' other rights, producerWarehouse may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer's access to the Service and any other website owned or operated by producerWarehouse.</li></ol>

<li><b>Counter - Notification.</b> If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to producerWarehouse is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the following address:

      <li>  a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</li>
       <li> your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your account;</li>
       <li> a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and your electronic or physical signature.</li>
       <li> Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability. If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification. However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service. You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice. </li></ol>

<li><b>Dispute Resolution</b></li>
<ol type = "1"><li>
<b>General</b>
 
Certain portions of this Paragraph L are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and producerWarehouse agree that we intend that this Paragraph L satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.
  <ol type ="a"><li><b>  First - Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.</b> If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Content, your User-Generated Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, "Dispute"), or to any of producerWarehouse' actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an "Excluded Dispute", which includes those actions set forth in Paragraph L(1)(b), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Paragraph L. Your notice to us must be sent via email to <a href ="#">support@producerwarehouse@com</a>. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, producerWarehouse and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or producerWarehouse to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and producerWarehouse, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.</li>
<li><b>Binding Arbitration.</b> If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Paragraph L (1)(a) (or agree to arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then<b> ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND producerWarehouse (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT— INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR NEGLIGENCE,—COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY), WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. THIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE PURCHASED THROUGH THE SERVICE OR ADVERTISING AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE. For U.S. residents, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between producerWarehouse and you regarding these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and the Service, including the "No Class Action Matters" Section below. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.</b> producerWarehouse and you agree, however, that the applicable state, federal or provincial law, as contemplated in Paragraph L(1)(f) below, shall apply to and govern, as appropriate, any and all claims or causes of action, remedies, and damages arising between you and producerWarehouse regarding these Terms and the Service, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to any jurisdiction's choice of law principles. Any Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules ("Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), except as modified herein, and the arbitration will be administered by the AAA. If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling to set a hearing then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ("JAMS") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of producerWarehouse consent to in writing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required and you are a U.S. resident, then it will be conducted Austin, Texas. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require producerWarehouse to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Paragraph L to be enforceable, then producerWarehouse will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who will apply and be bound by these Terms and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.<b>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions are for the court to decide. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms or the Service.</b> You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: AAA: 800.778.7879 and<a href ="#">Https://adr.org</a>
and JAMS: 800.352.5267 and<a href ="#">Https://jamsadr.org</a>.</li>
   <li><b> Limited Time to File Claims.TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH L(1)(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</b> Commencing means, as applicable: (a) by delivery of written notice as set forth above in Paragraph L (a); (b) filing for arbitration as set forth in Paragraph L (1)(b); or Paragraph L(f) filing an action in state, Federal or provincial court.
    Injunctive Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Paragraph L will not apply to any legal action taken by producerWarehouse to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or producerWarehouse' intellectual property rights (including such producerWarehouse may claim that may be in dispute), producerWarehouse' operations, and/or producerWarehouse' products or services.</li>
    <li><b>No Class Action Matters. YOU AND producerWarehouse AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION.</b> Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. <b>There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Paragraph L to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Paragraph L(1)(f). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Paragraph L, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein</b> (described in this "No Class Action Matters" section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.</li>
   <li><b>Jurisdictional Issues.</b> Except where arbitration is required above or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Austin, Texas.

<b>Updates to Terms</b>
<ol type ="1"><li><b>
General<ol type = "a">
    <li>These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the applicable services to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use). AS OUR SERVICE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SERVICE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING THE SERVICE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SERVICE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.</b></li>
   <li> Therefore, you should review the posted terms of use and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Service (at least prior to each transaction or submission). The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Service will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed. In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.</li>
    <li>You should frequently check the home page and the email you associated with your account for notices, and you agree that the means set forth in these Terms are all reasonable manners of providing you with notice. You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Service and related services.</li><ol>

<li><b>producer Warehouse' Consent or Approval</b></li>
    As to any provision in these Terms or any Additional Terms that grant producerWarehouse a right of consent or approval, or permits producerWarehouse to exercise a right in its "sole discretion," producerWarehouse may exercise that right in its sole and absolute discretion.

This Agreement cannot be changed or modified except as provided herein.

    <li><b>No Third Party Beneficiaries</b></li>

Nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person or entity, other than the parties hereto and their authorized successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 
    <li><b>Headings</b></li>
    The titles and headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Agreement. 
    <li><b>Assignment</b></li>
    producerWarehouse may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement at any time to any party. You may not assign your rights and/or obligations under this Agreement without obtaining producerWarehouse’ prior written consent. 
    <li><b>Indemnity</b></li>
    You agree to, and you hereby, defend, indemnify, and hold producerWarehouse Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, investigations, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, interest, and expenses (including attorneys' fees) that directly or indirectly arise from or are related to any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding made or brought against any producerWarehouse Party, or on account of the investigation, defense, or settlement thereof, arising out of or in connection with, whether occurring heretofore or hereafter: (i) your User-Generated Content; (ii) your use of the Service and your activities in connection with the Service; (iii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms or any Additional Terms; (iv) your violation or alleged violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances, or orders of any governmental or quasi-governmental authorities in connection with your use of the Service or your activities in connection with the Service; (v) information or material transmitted through your Device, even if not submitted by you, that infringes, violates, or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of any person or entity; (vi) any misrepresentation made by you; and (vii) producerWarehouse Parties' use of the information or content that you submit to us (including your User-Generated Content and Music Content) (all of the foregoing, "Claims and Losses").
    You will cooperate as fully required by producerWarehouse Parties in the defense of any Claims and Losses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, producerWarehouse Parties retain the exclusive right to settle, compromise, and pay any and all Claims and Losses. producerWarehouse Parties reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any Claims and Losses. You will not settle any Claims and Losses without, in each instance, the prior written consent of an officer of a producerWarehouse Party.

You agree to reimburse us, on demand, for any payment made by us at any time with respect to any Claims to which the foregoing indemnity applies. Pending the resolution of any claim, demand, or action, we may, at our election, withhold payment of any monies otherwise payable to you hereunder in an amount which does not exceed your potential liability to us pursuant to this Section.
    If we make an indemnification request to you under this Section, we may permit you to control the defense, disposition or settlement of the matter at your own expenses, provided that you shall not, without our prior written consent, enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition that requires any admission of liability by producerWarehouse or imposes any conditions or obligations on producerWarehouse other than the payment of monies that are readily measurable for purposes of determining your monetary indemnification or reimbursement obligations to us. If we, in our reasonable and good faith judgment conclude that you are not capable of defending your or our interests against any Claims, then we shall have the option to control the defense in any matter or litigation through counsel of our own choosing to defend against any such Claim for which you owe producerWarehouse an indemnification, and the costs of such counsel, as well as any court costs, shall be at your expense.

You and we disclaim any application to these Terms of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. 
    <li><b>Severability; Interpretation</b></li>
    If any provision of these Terms, or any Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the Additional Terms (which will remain in full force and effect).
    To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive, and you hereby waive, any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter. Wherever the word "including" is used in these Terms or any Additional Terms, the word will be deemed to mean "including, without limitation,". The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms. 
    <li><b>Communications</b></li>
